Text Processing and Compression | Course Project (Autumn ’23)
Prof. Ashutosh Gupta - Data Structures and Algorithms Lab
• Designed a dynamic context-based auto completion system in C++ using Prefix Trie data structure
• Applied the KMP Algorithm to enhance efficiency in recommendation generation based on user text history
• Studied the Lempel-Ziv’77 (1Z77) algorithm to perform lossless compression using back-referencing
• Implemented DEFLATE algorithm using Huffman Coding achieving 3.4:1 compression ratio on large text files
